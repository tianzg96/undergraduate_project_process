It contains all the processes of the whole simulation of my undergraduation peoject.

Step1:
  Use Yade, an open-source software using DEM, to create the ball stacking struture.

Step2:
  Use Matlab to process the file from Yade and generate the 0-1 structure file.
  
Step3:
  Use flowlbm3d, codes from Tong, to simulate the fluid process.
